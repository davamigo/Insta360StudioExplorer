[**Insta360 Studio 2022**](https://www.insta360.com/support/supportcourse?post_id=18191) is a desktop editing software for windows that allows the owners of Insta360 cameras to edit videos. As they say [on their website](https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-oners):

> **Insta360 Studio 2022** allows users to edit videos and photos shot on ONE RS/R, ONE X2/X, GO 2, Sphere, EVO, GO, ONE, Nano S, Nano and Air. It contains the Insta360 Plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro(2019/2020/2021) and Final Cut Pro X (only for ONE R wide-angle files) which enable you to open and edit mp4 files in Premiere/Final Cut Pro X.


## Development

I did this software to fix a problem I had with **Insta360 Studio 2022**: Every time I renamed or moved the `.insv` video files to another folder, I lost any previous editing I had done. That was very annoying for me, so I did some research and found out that the old projects were not lost; they are in a subfolder, inside the user's documents folder `C:\Users\User\Documents\Insta360\Studio\Project`. In this projects folder there are one subforder for each of the Insta380 projects. The name of the project subfolder seems to be an hexadecimal hash generated from the full path of the video file name. I call that hash `projectId`. So without knowing the hash function to generate the `projectId` is imposible to create new projects. However you can edit existing projects.

There are several files and subfolders inside the project subfolder:

* The **project file** with `.insprj` extension (eg. `VID_20220816_112725_00_001.insv.insprj`). This file is a simple XML, so it can be edited with any text editor.

* A folder called **`thumbnail`** containing many jpg files.
  
* Optionally a file called **`deeptrack.db`** (nmo est√° en todos los proyectos).
